<para>
  The following describes in general how to install this package
  in to a user directory.
  File and directory names may need to be altered slightly depending
  on your installation.
</para>

<para>
  First the distribution must be unpacked and placed
  some where in the home directory.

<para>
  This system has a Perl 5 module which is necessary
  to run the utility functions (qzm-load_file, qzm-preview_problem, etc).
  Shown below is how to create a locally accessable Perl 5
  library directory to link to these files.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
jeri@bishop ~$ mkdir -p lib/perl5
jeri@bishop ~$ cd lib/perl5
jeri@bishop perl5$ ln -s ~/QuizMaker/lib/perl5/QuizMaker.pm .
jeri@bishop perl5$ ln -s ~/QuizMaker/lib/perl5/QuizMaker .
jeri@bishop perl5$ cd
jeri@bishop ~$ # make sure PERL5LIB is not already defined
jeri@bishop ~$ env | grep PERL5
jeri@bishop ~$ # blank output OK
jeri@bishop ~$ export PERL5LIB="$HOME/lib/perl5"
jeri@bishop ~$ # place the above command in .bashrc to execute automatically
jeri@bishop ~$ env | grep PERL5
PERL5LIB=/home/jeri/lib/perl5
jeri@bishop ~$ # now it is defined correctly
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
  Once the above is successfully completed it should be possible to
  run the qzm-* functions in QuizMaker/bin.
</para>

<para>
  In order for the utility functions to be accessed the QuizMaker bin
  must be added to your PATH.  It should look something like below.
  If it doesn't the PATH must be configured (usually in your .bashrc
  like how PERL5LIB was configured).
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
jeri@bishop ~$ env | grep PATH
...
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/jeri/QuizMaker/bin
...
