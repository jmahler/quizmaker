  Once a test is scored it can be analyzed.
  For a single test the problems and their score can be viewed.
  The score can also be grouped by tags to see if there is any correlation.
  If there is signs of poor understanding correlated to specific tags
  a new test could be created that is weighted heavier with these tags.

  This process of testing and then analyzing the performance specific to tags
  has the potential to find the root cause of a students lack of performance.
  Consider the following situation.
  A test is taken and it is found that performance was poor on problems tagged
  with 'integration'.
  Another test is taken that is weighted heavier with 'integration' and it
  is found that performance was poor on problems tagged with 'partial fractions'.
  Another test is taken that is weighted heavier with 'partial fractions' and
  it is found that performance is poor with 'polynomial long division'.
  This process of isolating tags to focus on poorly performing subjects
  could be quite useful.
