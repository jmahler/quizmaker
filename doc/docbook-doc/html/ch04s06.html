There are several interesting side effects of the system that were not
designed in intentionally.
</p><p>
Because problems are defined by tags it is easy to discriminate between
groups of problems.
Two seperate subjects could be easily seperated using tags such as 'anthropology'
and 'mathematics'.
But it is also possible to merge these groups of problems togther in to
one test.
A test involving math, history, programming and art is something you would
never get in a standard class.
Whether this has much use other than being a novelty remains to be seen.
</p><p>
The possiblity of easily sharing problems is an interesting variation
with no current similarity.
Students in a class usually all have access to a common set of questions in a book.
But sharing of answers is seldom done and when the problems are on paper
it is cubersome to do so.
Of course it is beneficial for the student to struggle on an answer before
it is given to them but it may also be beneficial to see how others solve problems.
</p><p>
    A standard textbook will have a few detailed examples in the chapter.
    At the end of the chapter there will be a large number of exercises.
    And at the back of the book there will be answers to the odd questions.
    One difficulty with this situation is that the answers do not show
    all the steps.
    If they did the book would be many magnitudes larger so it makes sense
    why it is done this way.
    Using the QuizMaker system all problems are stored electronically so
    their is no comparable size constraints.
    The problems are stored in small text files and their size compared to
    the amount of disk space is miniscule.
    Every problem can be stored along with a complete and detailed solution.
</p><p>
    There is a certain method one performs while solving exercises.
    Attempt the exercise, review the notes if there is a difficulty,
    and check the answer at the end.
    This is drastically different than a test taking situation.
    A set of problems are given, there are no notes (except maybe a cheat sheet),
    you cannot check your answer, and there is a limited time period.
    The drastic differences between these two situations can help explain
    why taking tests can be very difficult.
    The QuizMaker system allows a student to create tests for himself
    that simulate test taking conditions more closely.
</p><p>
    Another difference between studying and taking tests is the
    order of problems.
    During studying a single section will be studied at a time
    and many similar problems will be solved.
    But in a test there will be problems from all the studied sections. 
    Obviously it would be difficult to learn a subject by studying all
    sections at once because some sections depend on knowledge gained from
    a previous section.
    But after studying a suction it would be worthwhile to test your self
    on not only that section but all the previous sections.
    This could be easily accomplished using the QuizMaker system.
