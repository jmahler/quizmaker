    The database will consist of a large number of problems.
    And it is necessary to be able to search the database to find
    relevant problems.
  </p><p>
    The text that defines the question and answer is one possible source
    of information about a problem.
    But its information is limited because it does not necessarily contain
    relevant keywords.
    A problem that involves "partial fractions" might only show the result
    with out saying "partial fractions was used at this step".
  </p><p>
    One solution is to allow every problem to define its own set of unique tags.
    In the previous example one tag would be "partial fractions".
    It could also have tags describing the class ("MATH-40") or any number
    of other possible things.
  </p><p>
    A benefit of using tags is that statistics can be generated based on them.
    It is possible to see if a student is scoring poorly relevant to a particular
    tag.
    The results of a test with tags can help zero in on subjects in which
    the student is doing poorly in and avoid those which he is doing well in.
  </p><p>
    The problem should have as many relevant tags as necessary in order to
    describe the problem.
    General tags such as the class it was used for (math-40, phys-42) or the
    main subject of study (math, physics).
    Grouping can be done by defining a unique tag among the group such as
    for a test.
    An example of a unique name might be: "MATH-40, test 3, 11/18/10, Bigler".
    Note, a test may also be defined outside of tags depending on the
    implementation.
    The relevant subject matter should be defined using tags but not overly so.
    For example, a problem in Calculus that uses addition should not have a tag
    for addition because it is so trivial at this level of math.
    If however the problem was for a first grade class a tag for addition
    might make sense.
