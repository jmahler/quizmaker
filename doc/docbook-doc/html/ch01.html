  Quizzes (or tests) are used to test a persons knowledge of
  a subject.
  A student will test themselves and a teach will test their students.
  But the methods for building, taking and scoring tests vary wildly
  and are often less than ideal.
</p><p>
  The QuizMaker system aims to improve this situation by providing a set
  of tools for building, taking and scoring tests more effectively.
</p><p>
  a database of test problems which can be quickly quiered to build tests.
  The user would add problems while studying the subject as opposed
  to sifting through all the sources to find problems.
  Each problem is organized by tags (e.g. integration, partial fractions).
  And tests can be built by searching for problems with specific tags.
  Statistics are created based on test scores to see if the user is lacking
  in in any areas (areas defined by tags).
</p><p>
  A student (or teacher) will often have a large amount of data available
  to them regarding the subject at hand (notes, example problems, book problems).
  But in order to create tests he must manually sift through all these
  sources to find suitable problems.
  If the student (or teacher) is the slightest bit dis-organized this
  large amount of data can quickly become unwieldly.
</p><p>
  Once problems are created they are each independent can be easily shared.
  Students could share them with other students.
  Teachers could provide problems to students and/or use the problems to
  build tests.
  It is possible to keep track of the problems that have been shown to
  a teachers students so that those problems are not re-shown on a test.
