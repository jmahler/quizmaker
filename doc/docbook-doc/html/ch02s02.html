    A teacher needs a way to easily build tests in which they can
    test their students with.
  </p><p>
    A teacher would typically build tests manually.
    They would creating novel problems or source them from books.
    Then they would use a word processing program to write the
    test and then make copies to give to the students during the test.
    Once all the students have taken the test and the tests have been
    scored they will know some general statistics such as the average score,
    the highest score, etc.
  </p><p>
    But there are several shortcomings in this method.
    It can be cumbersome and time consuming to build a test from scratch.
    There is likely very little information as to how appropriate
    a problem was and how well students have done on a particular problem.
