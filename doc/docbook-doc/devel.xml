<section>
  <title>Problem Definition</title>

  <para>
    Each problem should be defined independently of other problems.
    Tests and/or tags can be used to group similar problems after
    they have been registered in to the database.
    A file may be a good format in which to store a problem definition.
  </para>

  <para>
    The main values to be defined are the question and answer.
    These should be text and in a format such as LaTeX.
    LaTeX is a good choice because it supports math equations as
    well as images and other items well and it can be converted for
    printable output or to html.
    The file format must not conflict with any of the quotes or special characters
    in the rendering format of LaTeX.
  </para>

  <para>
    The definition should support arbitrary key=value pairs for defining
    any configuration or descriptions.
  </para>

  <para>
    Problems will be defined once and possibly updated later if a
    typo or other such problem is found.
  </para>

  <para>
    A program library should be defined for loading the problem definition
    and allow the use of the values.
  </para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>SQL Database</title>

<para>
  The database is used to store all the data about the problems
  and tests (tags, scores, tests (groups of problems)).
  The problems themselves are stored on the filesystem (not the database)
  since they are large text objects.
  This also makes it easier to place the problems under a version
  control system (such as <ulink url="http://www.git-scm.com">Git</ulink>
  or <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org">Svn</ulink>).
