The recommended way of editing the database schema is to dump the
entire thing, edit it, and then reload it.

The definition of the database stored in this directory should be a
recent dump of the database.
Maintaining a seperate manually edited file is time consuming and error
prone because it can easily diverge from the actual database.

See the Makefile for instructions on dumping, restoring, etc.

It is also good practice to copy a database dump before it is edited.
This way it is easy to see what changes were made by using the 'diff' command.
